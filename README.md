This project focuses on optimizing bus routes and schedules for the Delhi Transportation Corporation (DTC) using a Genetic Algorithm. By analyzing historical data (including GTFS feeds, such as stops, routes, and schedules), the system generates more efficient routes and timetables to minimize travel time, reduce traffic congestion, and improve overall service. 

The genetic algorithm iteratively selects, mutates, and evolves potential solutions to optimize bus routes and schedules, ensuring optimal coverage of high-demand areas while reducing operational costs.
